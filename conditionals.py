#2 conditional execution 
#2 alternative execution 
#2 chained conditionals 
#Use raw_input.
#Use good variable names.
#Use type conversion when necessary.
#Define at least 4 functions that do something substantial (not just adding 2 numbers or multiplying). At least 1 must return a boolean value and be used as a part of the flow control. At least one must return an integer or float. At least 1 must return a string. The 4th can do what ever you want.
#Define a main() function to organize the flow of your program. Be sure to #think about the three phases (input, processing, output)
#Use at least 3 different relational operators.
#Use each of the logical operators at least once. 
#Use random.random() and random.randint() at least once each in your script.
#Use str.format() at least once in your script.
#Use """ or ''' strings at least once in your script.
#Write an interesting and/or entertaining story/game.
#Use the same structure we learned about in the simple program assignment.
